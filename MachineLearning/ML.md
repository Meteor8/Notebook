# Machine Learning

## Week 1

### What is Machine Learning?

 "A computer program is said to learn from **experience E** with respect to some class of **tasks T** and **performance measure P**, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E." 

machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications: **Supervised learning** and **Unsupervised learning** 

### Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our __correct output__ should look like, having the idea that there is a __relationship__ between the input and the output. 

已知输入与输出间的关系

#### classification(归类)

In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a __continuous output__, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function 

关系方程为连续的，输出为连续的

#### regression(回归)

In a classification problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a __discrete output__. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories.  

输出为有限个的
